# challenge4-web-quiz-app

## Goals

The goals of this project were to create a front-end only quiz app in javascript that will display questions and accept multiple choice answers. This was also an excercise to practice creating html elements in code and to store and retrieve local data (in this case a highscore list).

## Features

- The app displays questions one at a time with 4 answers to choose from. The questions and answers are randomised each time the quiz is started.
- Incorrect answers remove time from the score timer.
- If time runs out or all questions are answered, the quiz ends and the user is given the option to enter their name into the highscore list or restart the quiz.
- The final score is the time taken to complete the quiz.
